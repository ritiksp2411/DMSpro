# DMSproject
Project in descrete Maths course for partial fulfillment of the course.This project is based on Euler graph and its various applications in real life.Also Fleury algorithm is mostly used to solve the problems for shortest path in Euler graph.This project includes fleury and DFS algorithms.

We did the solution to one such problem of cleaning roads of National Institute of Technology, Karnataka by travelling minimum possible distance.Visit Discretemaths.pdf file for futher details(It's a complete report in IEEE format about our project).

## Algorithms Used:
1. Fleury Algorithm
2. DFS for path
